# Scripting Snippets

This repository provides examples and snippets for the Go integration inside the HMI Suite of MONKEY WORKS GmbH.

## Context
The HMI Suite of MONKEY WORKS GmbH (https://www.monkey-works.de/) is a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) development environment to create native mobile hmi's (Human machine interfaces). Those apps can be used to monitor and control machines providing standardized communication protocols (OPC UA, RapidM2M REST, etc.). 
With the go integration user are able to implement custom go code which is embedded into created mobile apps. That way they can extend and adapt their designed apps for their usecases.  

## Use
This repository was created in order to provide examples how this integration may look like for certain usecases.

## Integration
For now every example is standalone and you just have to copy the example-folder into `$PROJECT_PATH/scripting/src`.
